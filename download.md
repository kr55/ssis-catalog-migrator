Download and follow the instructions from  [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=KunalRathi.ssiscatalogmigrator). 

Alternatively, if you have Visual Studio Data Tools 2017, you can download it from **Extensions and Updates** under the **Tools** menu item.

A good part of this option is that you automatically get an update installed in SSDT whenever a newer version of the wizard is available in the marketplace. Isnâ€™t that great!
